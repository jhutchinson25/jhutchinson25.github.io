    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Healthcare Scheduling Optimization via Probabilistic Modeling</strong><br />
        Developed conditional kernel density models to estimate appointment durations and no-show probabilities. Created optimization heuristics to align scheduled durations with actual visit times under uncertainty.<br />
        <em>Impact:</em> Increased patients seen by over 20% annually by improving provider utilization.<br />
        <strong>Tools:</strong> Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
      </li>
      <li><strong>Customer Churn Prediction & Deployment on Azure ML</strong><br />
        Built a modular pipeline using Azure ML SDK v2 to preprocess data, train, and deploy a churn classifier. Registered models with MLflow, deployed to a REST endpoint for real-time inference. Integrated versioned datasets and MLOps best practices.<br />
        <strong>Tools:</strong> Azure ML, MLflow, scikit-learn, Streamlit, Python
      </li>
      <li><strong>Show Jumping Performance Prediction</strong><br />
        IEEE SIEDS Published Research | Best Undergraduate Engineering Paper, Liberty University (2024)<br />
        Extracted and engineered features from webscraped horse and rider data. Trained ranking models to predict top finishers in show jumping competitions.<br />
        <em>Impact:</em> Provided interpretable models used for performance scouting and analytics.<br />
        <strong>Tools:</strong> scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup
