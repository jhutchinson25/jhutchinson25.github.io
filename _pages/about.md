# About Me
I’m John Hutchinson, a data scientist and cloud engineer focused on applying machine learning and operations research to real-world decision-making problems—especially in healthcare.

My recent work centered on optimizing clinical scheduling through probabilistic modeling. By estimating appointment durations and no-show probabilities using conditional kernel density methods, I developed scheduling algorithms that could increase provider utilization and throughput, resulting in a >20% increase in patients seen annually.

Beyond healthcare, I’ve built full-stack ML solutions using Azure ML SDK v2, MLflow, and Streamlit, deploying real-time scoring endpoints for business applications like customer churn prediction. I specialize in statistical modeling, cloud-based MLOps, and interpretable machine learning using tools like SHAP and Dask.

I hold the Azure Data Scientist Associate (DP-100) certification and have published research on performance modeling in sports analytics. I’m recently received a B.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering with a Mathematics minor at Liberty University, where I focused on data-driven optimization and applied ML systems.
