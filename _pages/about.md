## Selected Projects

### Healthcare Scheduling Optimization via Probabilistic Modeling  
- Developed conditional kernel density models to estimate appointment durations and no-show probabilities.  
- Created optimization heuristics to align scheduled durations with actual visit times under uncertainty.  
- **Impact:** Increased patients seen by over 20% annually by improving provider utilization.  
- **Tools:** Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn

### Customer Churn Prediction & Deployment on Azure ML  
- Built modular Azure ML pipelines for data preprocessing, training, and deploying a churn classifier.  
- Registered models with MLflow and deployed to REST endpoints for real-time inference.  
- Followed MLOps best practices including versioned datasets and compute cluster management.  
- **Tools:** Azure ML SDK v2, MLflow, scikit-learn, Streamlit, Python

### Show Jumping Performance Prediction  
- Published research (IEEE SIEDS) and recipient of Best Undergraduate Engineering Paper at Liberty University (2024).  
- Extracted and engineered features from webscraped horse and rider data (age, competition history, variability).  
- Trained ranking models to predict top finishers in show jumping competitions.  
- **Impact:** Provided interpretable models used for performance scouting and analytics.  
- **Tools:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup
